# Starrydata visualizer

[Starrydata project](https://starrydata.org/) utilizes [Starrydata2 web system](https://www.starrydata2.org/) to collect experimental data from materials science research papers. The collected data is published as datasets on the [Starrydata project page on Figshare](https://figshare.com/projects/Starrydata_datasets/155129). However, visualizing big data requires an analytical environment. To address this, Starrydata Visualizer offers pre-prepared graphs, allowing even those without an analytical environment to easily view an overview of the data. The data is updated daily for use in data cleansing by the [Starrydata team's data collectors](https://starrydata.org/project/members.html).

## Graph categories
